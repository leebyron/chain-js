Is it possible to use web workers to run most of the instances? If modeled not
as a queue but as a possible dependency graph (eg, some things cannot be
dependents but others might but not guaranteed to be) then you know when
multiple functions can be run in parallel. The tricky piece is that a web worker
is *always* async, so you might not be able to run the lot in a sync flow and
would lose the ability to skip multiple executions of the same instance
repeatedly.
